# weather-app
 This is an website developed with JavaScript, CSS and HTML that informs the weather of a given location. The user must first type the name of a city, click in submit, and then it will appear the temperature in Celsius degrees and an icon and a description that represents the currently weather. The user then has an option to return to the first page and choose a new location.
 
 
 The animated icons are the creation of [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/).
